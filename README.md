## Hi, I'm Annie Finnerty.

### I'm a software engineer/frontend designer from Denver Colorado with three years freelance experience building websites, apps and software.

### I like finding elegant solutions to complex design problems on the front end and back end.

### I build projects in Java, C#, and many flavors and frameworks of JS (but React.js is the best). I'm currently studying Go. </p>

### In my free time I enjoy hiking, painting, finding new beers, oil painting and throwing knives.
